# A Dashboard for Wallet App

Inspired by the dribble post. I tried to create a UI page that looks as close as it could. The UI seems to be having the latest UI/UX treand of "Neumorphism". The Dribble post can be found on the link -> https://dribbble.com/shots/9084817-Conceptual-Dashboard-Screen. 

The Application has been developed in Flutter which is an cross-platform development toolkit for android and iOS application development.
